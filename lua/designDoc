Need a table (maybe with nested tables) per line of procRate, Trigger, Strings to print
Need to dynamically create/modify/delete tables and/or table items

Probably need a table to hold all the tables for each rule (Maybe "allRules")

need to keep account of number of strings inside the table/array of strings to print
maybe an int argc Char **argv[] thing

Prototype Table Structure:

ruleTable

Need a trigger  			(maybe a few static events to start testing with)
Need a min/max procRate  	(Should this be drop down or text field)
Need count of array items  	(like argc)
Need array of Strings      	(like argv[])





GUI Stuff
Parent Window
No config =  Show "+" button
"+" button onClick creates frame
frame has "Trigger" DropDown, "percent proc" text field, "Say This" field
say this should have a "+" icon.

existing frames populate
"+" button that creates a new frame
